# Crime-Data-Analytics-System
The city of San Francisco will provide a wide variety of datasets to 
the public via its portal of data.sfgov.org. In the framework of the 
work, the San Francisco police department incident reports dataset 
was selected, which had historical data from 2018 to 2024. It 
contains about 80,000 entries with 32 attributes of detailed 
information on incidents. 
The big task statement involves the design of a Distributed Data 
system that will get raw or unstructured data, process the same, 
and transform the same into actionable insights to be shown on an 
interactive dashboard. This uses SFPD data retrieved via an API as 
the feed of the data to create structured data and visualizations 
henceforth. 
This will further help stakeholders formulate hypotheses that they 
can analyze more deeply, thereby coming up with more solid 
predictive models useful in the understanding and retardation of the 
trends of crime in San Francisco
